# Problems

- When the form is submitted I'm able to push group name, group description, and rules but not more than 2 rules
- The form on Rule section input fields are able to add and delete but not able to push more than 2 input fields to the browse group revenue section.
- In browse revenue groups section I'm able to delete but when is delete it's not sorting each of the id (from small number to big number).
